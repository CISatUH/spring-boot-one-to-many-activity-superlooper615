# cis3368-one-to-many
In this exercise, you will build a SpringBoot application that implements a one to many relationship between two tables.

The video series on Youtube at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-7krswAOsgveRgsxpQ8xgtpHglJ6mNgL walks through the building of the application. Your assignment is to watch the videos and code along with them to create the app. 

*The videos use the PostgreSQL database. Part of the assignment is to use H2 instead, so you need to substitute H2 configurations, etc. every time you see PostgreSQL.* For example, when going to the SpringBoot web site (in the first video) to get the components for the application, you should put in H2, not PostgreSQL as shown in the video.
